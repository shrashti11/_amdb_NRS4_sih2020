# _amdb_NRS4_sih2020

Getting Started

Project intents to Create Aerodrome Maps and Charts using feature extraction from Satellite Imagery and blending that with existing Aerodrome Maps and provide an interactive 2D map containing a spatial layout of the acrodrome in terms of features (e.g. runways, taxiways, parking stands) with geometry described as points, lines or polygons, and with attributes (eg, surface type).

Prerequisites

No Prerequisites to run through hosting link.

However, to run the app locally in the machine, you would require:
1. Python 3.0 & above
2. VS Code/Pycharm/IDLE/any similar IDE
3. Django 3.0
4. Google Map API Key(geolocation)

Installation

1. Python latest version : https://www.python.org/
2. Get a free API Key at : https://developers.google.com
3. VS Code Download : https://code.visualstudio.com 

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/shrashti11/_amdb_NRS4_sih2020

Install Django through command line :
Firstly you can verify that Python is installed by typing python from your shell; you should see something like:

Python 3.x.y
[GCC 4.x] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
